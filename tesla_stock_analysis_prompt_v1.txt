**PART 1: Chronological Trend Analysis (2021-2024)**

For each calendar year, identify 2-3 major stock price trends (rallies, declines, or high-volatility periods). For each trend:

1. **Trend Identification**
   - Approximate date range (e.g., "March 2021 - June 2021")
   - Trend type: Rally, Decline, Consolidation, or High Volatility
   - Approximate magnitude (if available in news: e.g., "stock rose ~40%")

2. **News Correlation**
   - 3-5 specific news events during this period with exact dates
   - Direct quotes or key facts from articles
   - Source citations (prioritize: Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, Financial Times, CNBC, Associated Press)
   
3. **Categorization**
   Mark each news item as:
   - [COMPANY] Company-specific: earnings, deliveries, production, product launches, executive changes
   - [MACRO] Macroeconomic: Fed policy, inflation, recession fears, market-wide movements
   - [INDUSTRY] EV industry/competition: rival announcements, supply chain, regulations
   - [MUSK] Elon Musk-related: Twitter/X acquisition, public statements, controversies
   - [POLICY] Government/regulatory: tax credits, investigations, policy changes

4. **Causation Assessment**
   - Rate the likely impact: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
   - Note whether news preceded or followed price movement
   - Flag if multiple factors coincided

**PART 2: All-Time Peak Analysis (December 17, 2024)**

Provide a focused investigation of the December 17, 2024 peak:

1. **Q4 2024 Build-Up (October 1 - December 16, 2024)**
   - List 5-8 major news events/catalysts in chronological order
   - Include: earnings reports, delivery numbers, product news, political developments, analyst upgrades
   - Specify exact dates and sources

2. **Immediate Catalysts (December 1-17, 2024)**
   - Identify any specific triggers in the 2 weeks before the peak
   - Include market sentiment, sector rotation, year-end positioning if relevant

3. **Peak Day Context (December 17, 2024)**
   - What news or developments occurred on or immediately before this date?
   - Broader market conditions (S&P 500, Nasdaq performance, sector trends)
   - Trading volume or technical factors mentioned in news

4. **Synthesis**
   - What appears to be the primary catalyst(s) for the all-time high?
   - Were there multiple reinforcing factors?
   - Any contrarian viewpoints or skepticism mentioned in coverage?

</analysis_framework>

<research_requirements>
- **Only use verifiable sources**: Major financial news outlets, press releases, SEC filings
- **Provide exact dates**: Use format "Month DD, YYYY" for all events
- **Include direct evidence**: Brief quotes or specific data points from articles
- **Distinguish fact from speculation**: Clearly label analyst predictions vs. confirmed news
- **Show temporal relationships**: Explicitly note if news came before/during/after price movements
- **Cite every claim**: Use format [Source Name, Date] after each news reference
